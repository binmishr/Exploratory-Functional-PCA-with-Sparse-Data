# Exploratory-Functional-PCA-with-Sparse-Data

brolgar is a beautiful, tidyverse inspired package, based on the tsibble data structure that offers a number of super helpful functions for visualizing and manipulating longitudinal data. See the arXiv paper Tierney, Cook and Prvan (2021) for an overview, and the seven package vignettes for examples. Collectively, these vignettes offer a pretty thorough exploration of the wages data set. Using wages for this post should provide a feeling for what additional insight FDA may have to offer.

The perticular code set is attached here in the .docx file. Please refer.
